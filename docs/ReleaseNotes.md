## Next Version ##

The code has been completely rewritten to provide more flexibility going forward.
Existing code should generally work, except as noted below.

- `NamedParameter` - the attribute still accepts ShortName and LongName, but they are obsolete.
The `LongName` and `ShortName` attributes should be used instead, as they give the ability
to add multiple long/short names.
-  Other stuff
