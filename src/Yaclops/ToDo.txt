- Continue work on group options - injection - try: sample add foo --show-logo
- Allow mix-ins in addition to inheritence; if command object includes specially-attributed object, grab its props, too
- Handle enums and list of enums
- Add support for fields (in addition to properties)
- Add support for complex meta-rules (if -b is specified, field X is required or w/e - custom Func passed by user)
- If duplicate short/long names are specified at the SAME LEVEL, emit a warning
- Figure out a way to make description and other text dynamic. For example, to embed a const in a description
  or reference another parameter/command.
